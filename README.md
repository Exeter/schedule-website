Notes for Beginners

To setup for the first time, install nodejs, heroku-toolbelt, and bower. Run npm install and then bower install to install dependencies of project. To run the project locally, use foreman start.

The project runs the server.js file in the build folder, and any events stored in that file will be written to the page on screen.
